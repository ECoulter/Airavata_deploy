Scripts for building apache airavata 
 - Currently works on CentOS 7 minimal install (other options should be fine as well)
 - Must have selinux disabled! So don't do this in production! This is still a TODO. 
 - The "ansible/complete_install.sh" shows the steps needed, or you can just try running from that. 
 
The bash scripts are unfinished, and may not be, if ansible proves satisfactory.
